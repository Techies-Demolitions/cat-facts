BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE!
LISTEN! HEAR! SEE! WHATEVER!

STRICTLY DO NOT WRITE MAIN BRANCH OR I WILL KILL Y..

Jokes aside.

Rulesets:

## Main-branch is strictly READ-ONLY
To say this differently, branches are used to push into this branch for safety purposes. Do not push directly to it.




PS
- This repository is free and with that I can't set rules for branch protection. Obey my rules or die with the hand of God!
