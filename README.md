# Cat Facts Repository
This repository stores random cat facts using the Cat Facts API. It was created as a learning exercise.

## IMPORTANT!
DO NOT PUSH DIRECTLY TO THE MAIN BRANCH OR I WILL KILL Y...

Just kidding. But seriously, don't.

## Rules:
## Main Branch is Strictly Read-Only
To clarify, the main branch is for final, stable code only. Always create and work on a separate branch, then merge your changes into the main branch. Direct pushes to the main branch are not allowed.

## Additional Notes:
- This is an open repository, so I can't enforce branch protection. But please, follow the rules or die with the hand of God!
- I'll be adding more rules in the future. Iâ€™m a bit tired right now.
